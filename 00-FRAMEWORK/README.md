# DGCP Framework  
## Data Governance & Continuous Proof (DGCP)

---

## 1. Purpose of the Framework

The DGCP Framework defines a **general, non-national, non-institutional architecture**
for governing **Real-World Data (RWD)** generated by human labor, daily activities,
and lived environments.

This framework is designed to be:
- Country-agnostic
- Institution-neutral
- Technology-adaptive
- Grounded in verifiable proof rather than authority

DGCP does not assume the existence of centralized power, advanced infrastructure,
or legal harmonization. It begins from the **lowest common denominator of reality**:
a human performing real work, leaving traceable evidence over time.

---

## 2. Core Problem Addressed

Modern data systems suffer from three structural failures:

1. **Detachment from Reality**  
   Large-scale datasets are often abstracted, aggregated, or synthesized
   without persistent links to real-world origin.

2. **Loss of Attribution**  
   The individuals who generate data through labor or life activities
   rarely retain recognition, control, or value from that data.

3. **Trust Without Proof**  
   Trust is placed in institutions, platforms, or declarations
   rather than in cryptographically verifiable, time-linked evidence.

DGCP addresses these failures by re-centering data governance on **proof of reality**.

## 3. Foundational Principles

### 3.1 Proof Before Authority

DGCP prioritizes:
- Cryptographic timestamps
- Immutable records
- Public verifiability

Over:
- Institutional claims
- Centralized validation
- Reputation-based trust

---

### 3.2 Continuous Over Static

Reality is not a snapshot.

DGCP treats data as:
- Continuously generated
- Time-sequenced
- Append-only

Rather than:
- One-time reports
- Retrospective summaries
- Editable narratives

---

### 3.3 Human-Origin First

DGCP explicitly centers:
- Human labor
- Lived experience
- Physical-world interaction

Before:
- Synthetic data
- Automated generation
- Detached analytics

---

## 4. What DGCP Is Not

This framework explicitly does **not**:
- Propose national policy
- Represent any government
- Replace legal systems
- Mandate implementation
- Claim universal applicability

DGCP is a **reference framework**, not an enforcement mechanism.

---

## 5. Applicability Across Contexts

DGCP can be adapted to:
- Agriculture
- Environmental monitoring
- Public health observation
- Informal economies
- Community-based data initiatives

It does **not** require:
- Advanced hardware
- Government sponsorship
- Large-scale funding
- Centralized databases

---

## 6. Ethical Orientation

DGCP is grounded in the belief that:

> People who generate reality should not disappear inside the data economy.

The framework seeks to:
- Restore visibility to small-scale contributors
- Prevent extraction without acknowledgment
- Enable participation without coercion

---

## 7. Relationship to National Contexts

National implementations (e.g., DGCP-for-Thailand) are treated as:
- Case studies
- Contextual adaptations
- Comparative references

They do not define the framework itself.

The framework exists **before**, **outside**, and **beyond** any single country.

---

## 8. Temporal Scope

This framework reflects understanding as of **December 2025**.

It is expected to evolve as:
- Technologies change
- Legal interpretations shift
- Societal values develop

---

## 9. License & Use

This framework is published under the **MMFARM-POL-2025 License**.

Use, citation, or derivative work must:
- Preserve attribution
- Respect non-prescriptive intent
- Avoid misrepresentation as policy or authority
