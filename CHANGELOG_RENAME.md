# Repository Rename Note  
**Date:** 2025-12-06  
**New Name:** `DGCP-for-Thailand`  
**Author:** P’Toh / MaMeeFarm™

---

## 🎯 Reason for Renaming

The previous repository name focused mainly on the internal RWD (Real-World Data) system of MaMeeFarm™.  
However, the direction of the project has expanded beyond farm-level data and now aims to include:

1. **National-Level Data Governance Analysis**  
   DGCP™ is no longer only a farm system; it has grown into a national framework for protecting workers’ data rights.

2. **Policy Design for Thailand**  
   This repository will host analyses, policy gaps, recommendations, and structural proposals for implementing DGCP™ at the national scale.

3. **Clarity & Accuracy of Purpose**  
   The new name reflects an explicit mission:
   > “DGCP™ for Thailand” = A Real-World Data governance blueprint for the country.

4. **Separation of Concerns**  
   - MaMeeFarm™ = The original Real-World Data source, proofs, and farm operations  
   - DGCP-for-Thailand = Research, design, governance, and national policy frameworks  
   
   This separation prevents confusion and keeps each repository’s purpose clean and scalable.

5. **Preparation for International Review**  
   As DGCP™ attracts interest outside Thailand, a dedicated repository focused on Thailand’s national architecture improves transparency for researchers, policymakers, and future collaborators.

## 📌 Impact of Rename

- All previous files remain preserved.  
- Future commits in this repository will focus on *national-level frameworks*.  
- Farm-level DGCP™ proofs and metadata stay in their original repos.  
- README, architecture documents, and governance files will be updated under the new direction.

## ✔ Vision of This Repository

To create **Thailand’s first open, human-first, Real-World Data governance framework**  
that protects citizens’ rights, supports farmers and workers,  
and establishes DGCP™ as a global-standard model of ethical data architecture.
