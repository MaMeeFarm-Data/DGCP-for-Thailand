# Open Questions & Research Boundaries

## Purpose of This Section

This section defines the **explicit research boundaries** of the DGCP-for-Thailand repository.

DGCP-for-Thailand is designed as an **open, exploratory, and research-oriented reference**, not as a policy mandate, governmental proposal, or prescriptive national framework.

The purpose of documenting open questions is to:
- Preserve intellectual honesty
- Prevent premature conclusions
- Protect against misinterpretation or misuse of this work
- Invite structured inquiry rather than enforce decisions

This repository intentionally distinguishes **what is observed, analyzed, and designed** from **what remains undecided or institutionally unresolved**.

---

## Nature of the Open Questions

All questions documented here are:
- Non-binding
- Non-prescriptive
- Contextual and time-bound
- Open to reinterpretation as conditions evolve

They do **not** imply:
- National endorsement
- Governmental authority
- Legal obligation
- Policy recommendation

---

## Categories of Open Questions

### 1. Governance & Authority

- Who should legitimately steward a national-scale Real-World Data (RWD) governance framework?
- How should authority be distributed between state institutions, communities, and individual data producers?
- What governance models can prevent centralization without creating fragmentation?

---

### 2. Legal & Institutional Alignment

- How can proof-based data systems coexist with existing legal frameworks?
- What institutional adaptations are required before enforcement or regulation is considered?
- How should conflicts between legacy data laws and proof-based systems be resolved?

---

### 3. Data Ownership & Consent

- What constitutes meaningful consent in long-term, real-world data generation?
- How should revocation, withdrawal, or partial consent be handled?
- Who bears responsibility when data outlives its original context?

---

### 4. Economic & Incentive Design

- How can value be fairly distributed to real-world data producers?
- What economic mechanisms prevent exploitation while enabling sustainability?
- Should data-as-labor be treated as income, property, or participation?

---

### 5. Political Risk & Misuse

- How can proof-based data systems be protected from political capture?
- What safeguards prevent selective enforcement or narrative manipulation?
- How should transparency coexist with civic safety and privacy?

## Explicit Non-Claims

This repository explicitly **does not claim**:

- To represent the Thai government or any public authority
- To provide national policy recommendations
- To mandate implementation timelines
- To offer legal, financial, or regulatory advice
- To guarantee completeness or nationwide coverage

DGCP-for-Thailand remains an **independent research effort**, documented in good faith and open to scrutiny.

---

## Invitation to Inquiry

These open questions are not weaknesses of the project.

They are deliberate **signals of maturity**, acknowledging that:
- Complex systems cannot be finalized in isolation
- National-scale data governance requires plural perspectives
- Responsible design begins with restraint

Researchers, policymakers, institutions, and the public are invited to **think with this work**, not to act on it uncritically.

## Temporal Context

This document reflects understanding as of **December 2025**.

Technological, legal, social, and institutional conditions may change.  
Future interpretations should account for evolving contexts.
