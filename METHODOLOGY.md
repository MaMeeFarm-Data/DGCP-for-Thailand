# Methodology  
## DGCP-for-Thailand

This document describes the methodological approach used throughout
the DGCP-for-Thailand repository.

The purpose of this methodology is not to claim predictive authority,
but to ensure transparency, traceability, and analytical integrity
across all sections.

---

## 1. Research Orientation

DGCP-for-Thailand is a **structural research project** focused on:

- Data Governance
- Real-World Data (RWD)
- Observability of economic and social activity
- Institutional and non-institutional data flows

The project does **not** aim to:
- Propose official policy
- Represent any government position
- Advocate regulatory adoption

It exists as an independent analytical framework.

---

## 2. Analytical Method

The research applies a **qualitative, comparative, and systems-oriented approach**:

- Structural comparison across regions and countries
- Pattern recognition instead of metric optimization
- Contextual interpretation over statistical generalization

Primary techniques include:
- Cross-context synthesis
- Institutional gap analysis
- Ground-level observability reasoning
- Constraint-based system thinking

No econometric modeling or forecasting is performed.

---

## 3. Use of Comparative References

Country and regional references are used as:

- Structural signals
- Comparative mirrors
- Stress-test environments

They are **not** treated as benchmarks, rankings, or normative examples.

The inclusion of any country does not imply endorsement,
superiority, or replication intent.

---

## 4. Data Sources & Scope

Sources may include:
- Publicly available policy documents
- Academic and institutional literature
- Observed structural patterns in real-world systems
- Prior DGCP research artifacts

No confidential, personal, or restricted data is used.

All analysis operates at the **systemic level**, not the individual level.

---

## 5. Limitations

This research acknowledges the following limitations:

- Contexts evolve over time
- Institutional behaviors may change
- Observations reflect the period of writing (December 2025)
- Interpretations are bounded by available public information

The project intentionally avoids claims of completeness.

---

## 6. Research Integrity & Non-Intervention

DGCP-for-Thailand maintains strict boundaries:

- No policy recommendation
- No enforcement guidance
- No operational instruction for governments
- No advisory role is implied

The work is published for **analysis, learning, and dialogue** only.

---

## 7. Update & Versioning Philosophy

The repository follows an additive approach:

- New insights are added
- Previous files are not retroactively altered
- Contextual evolution is preserved over time

This ensures analytical traceability and historical integrity.
