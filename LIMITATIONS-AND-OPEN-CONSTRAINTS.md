# Limitations and Open Constraints

## 1. Scope Limitations

This repository reflects an independent research effort conducted outside formal governmental or institutional frameworks.

As such, it does not have:
- Direct access to classified, confidential, or restricted national datasets
- Official mandates to enforce policy adoption
- Institutional authority to validate or certify external implementations

The analysis is based on publicly observable systems, real-world documentation, and open research methods.

---

## 2. Data Availability Constraints

All data referenced in this repository is limited to:
- Publicly accessible sources
- Voluntarily documented real-world data
- Open repositories and transparent records

This project does not claim completeness or total national coverage.

Gaps in data availability are acknowledged as part of the current research environment.

---

## 3. Temporal Limitations

This work represents a snapshot of understanding within a specific time context.

Technological, regulatory, and institutional conditions may change over time.
Earlier analyses may not fully reflect future developments.

Historical commits are preserved to maintain transparency of intellectual evolution.

---

## 4. Interpretive Boundaries

The interpretations presented are analytical, not prescriptive.

They are intended to:
- Stimulate discussion
- Support comparative research
- Provide structural insights

They should not be interpreted as final conclusions or binding recommendations.

---

## 5. External Dependency Risks

Any application of ideas derived from this repository depends on:
- Local legal frameworks
- Institutional readiness
- Cultural and operational conditions

The authors cannot account for all contextual variables across different jurisdictions.

---

## 6. Open Questions and Future Work

This repository intentionally leaves certain questions unresolved.

These open constraints are not weaknesses, but invitations for:
- Further research
- Peer review
- Cross-institutional collaboration

Future iterations may address these limitations as new data and perspectives emerge.
