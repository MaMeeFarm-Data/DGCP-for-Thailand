## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document records a set of **open research questions** that arise from
the DGCP-for-Thailand project.

These questions are intentionally presented **without answers**.

They do not represent conclusions, policy recommendations,
or implementation proposals.
Their sole purpose is to preserve intellectual openness
and to acknowledge structural uncertainty within existing data systems.

---

## 2. Research Positioning

The questions in this section are framed under the following principles:

- No attribution of responsibility  
- No normative judgment  
- No implied solutions  
- No call for action  

They are documented to support long-term inquiry,
comparative research, and future evidence-based exploration.

---

## 3. Questions on Visibility of Real-World Conditions

- What forms of daily human activity remain structurally invisible
  within national data systems?
- How much socio-economic stress occurs before it becomes visible
  in aggregated indicators?
- Which lived realities are consistently delayed or excluded
  from official statistical representation?

---

## 4. Questions on Data Ownership and Origin

- Who is the original owner of data generated by daily human labor?
- Can real-world data exist independently of platform ownership models?
- What distinguishes human-origin data from system-generated data
  in governance contexts?

---

## 5. Questions on Governance Feedback Loops

- How long do governance feedback loops take to respond
  to changes at the ground level?
- What risks emerge when policy decisions rely on delayed data?
- Can governance systems remain resilient under partial observability?

---

## 6. Questions on Technology, AI, and Trust

- Can AI systems be responsibly developed without verifiable
  real-world data provenance?
- How does the absence of contextual data affect trust
  in automated or data-driven decisions?
- Is technical accuracy sufficient without lived context?

---

## 7. Questions on Cross-National Patterns

- Why do structurally different countries exhibit similar data blind spots?
- Are these blind spots systemic rather than national in nature?
- What patterns repeat across ASEAN, EU, and Global South contexts?

---

## 8. Questions on the Role of DGCP™

- Can a parallel data layer coexist with institutional data systems
  without disruption?
- What are the limits of non-prescriptive data governance models?
- At what point does observation itself influence governance behavior?

---

## 9. Closing Reflection

These questions are documented without expectation of immediate resolution.

They are preserved to maintain research integrity,
to invite multidisciplinary perspectives,
and to ensure that future conclusions—if any—emerge from evidence,
not assumption.
