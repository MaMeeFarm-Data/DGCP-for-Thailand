# MMFARM-RWD-2025  
### 🌾 The Real-World Data System by MaMeeFarm, Thailand  

---

## 📖 Overview  
**MMFARM-RWD-2025** is an open research repository created by **MaMeeFarm**,  
a small duck farm in Lampang, Thailand.  
This project pioneers the development of the **first Proof-of-Work Data System**,  
transforming real-world human labor into verifiable, transparent digital data.  

Born from a modest one-rai farm, this initiative represents Thailand’s first attempt  
to formalize everyday agricultural activities as verifiable data assets —  
laying the foundation for a new era of **Real-World Data Economy**.  

> “From real work to real data — from a duck farm to the world.”  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Develop a prototype of the **Proof-of-Work Data (PoWD)** system.  
- Establish Thailand’s first **Real-World Data (RWD)** model for agriculture.  
- Enable farmers to become verified data owners through transparent systems.  
- Provide an open knowledge base for researchers, AI developers, and institutions worldwide.  
- Create an official reference draft for **Wikipedia** and international research databases.

## 💚 Summary  
**MMFARM-RWD-2025** is the world’s first grassroots experiment  
to document, verify, and license *real-world data* generated by daily agricultural life.  

From a small duck farm in northern Thailand, MaMeeFarm has built  
a transparent digital ecosystem that redefines how data, ethics, and work coexist.  

> Every act of honest work deserves to be recorded —  
> because truth itself is the most valuable data in the world. 🌍

## 🌍 Real-Work Data Architecture

MaMeeFarm’s **RWD-2025** framework connects *real-world labor → verifiable data → digital asset value*  
in a continuous proof chain that anyone can audit.

Life + Data + Asset + Value = Global Model of Work Transparency

### System Overview
| Layer | Platform | Function |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Real-Life Proof | [TikTok @MaMeeFarm](https://www.tiktok.com/@mameefarm) | Daily human activity captured in video |
| Narrative & Log | [Blogger – MaMeeFarm.com](https://www.mameefarm.com) | Descriptive record linked to each day |
| Digital Proof | [OpenSea – 7 Ducks of Hope](https://opensea.io/collection/mameefarm-7-ducks-of-hope) / [Seed of Hope](https://opensea.io/collection/seed-of-hope-mameefarm) | NFT minted as a certificate of work |
| Blockchain Core | [Polygon ERC-1155 Contract](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xe2215335aa50b87d1c9df9b3af4fcf6c4217f07e) | Immutable proof of origin, time, and owner |
| Data Integrity | [GitHub Metadata Hub](https://github.com/MaMeeFarm-Data/MaMeeFarm-Concepts) | JSON-LD metadata, hash, timestamp, and version control |

### Verification Flow
1. **Real Action →** Work performed on farm  
2. **TikTok →** Public “Proof-of-Life” video  
3. **Blogger →** Narrative post linking video + NFT  
4. **OpenSea / Polygon →** NFT token minted & stored on-chain  
5. **GitHub →** Metadata and cryptographic hash published for audit  

This creates a **transparent bridge between human work and digital systems**, allowing AI and researchers to study verified real-world data instead of synthetic content.

## 🔭 Research Vision 2030

MaMeeFarm’s goal is to make **Real-Work Data** a recognized global standard of ethical data provenance.

| Phase | Goal |
|-------|------|
| 2025 – 2026 | Proof-of-Work Farm Data (establish the model) |
| 2027 – 2028 | Real-Work API for open integration |
| 2029 – 2030 | Decentralized Network of Real-Work Nodes (MaMeeFarm → Global) |

> 🪶 *Every duck, every egg, every day — becomes proof that life itself can be data with integrity.*

# 🇹🇭 DGCP™ for Thailand  
**National Real-World Data Governance Framework**  
by MaMeeFarm™

---

## 🌏 Overview

**DGCP™ for Thailand** is the national-level extension of the DGCP™  
(Duck Governance & Continuous Proof) system originally developed from  
real-world labor at MaMeeFarm™.

This repository serves as a **policy, architecture, and data-governance blueprint**  
designed to protect the data rights of Thai workers, farmers, and citizens —  
ensuring that Real-World Data (RWD) becomes an asset **owned by humans, not platforms**.

DGCP™ establishes a verifiable, immutable, and human-first data system  
that global AI models and institutions can trust.

This repository is the **National Layer** of DGCP™.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Analyze Thailand’s socio-economic and labor structure**  
   Identify why Thai workers lose control of their data and how platforms extract value.

2. **Expose Policy Gaps** in Thailand’s current data and digital governance framework.  
   Highlight risk areas and opportunities for reform.

3. **Design Thailand-specific DGCP™ Architecture**  
   - Data Rights Framework  
   - Proof-of-Work-Life  
   - Traceable RWD Ledger  
   - Community-Owned Data Models  
   - National interoperability standards

4. **Provide a 2025–2030 Roadmap**  
   For provincial pilots (e.g., Lampang) → national adoption.

5. **Establish a transparent and ethical Real-World Data infrastructure**  
   where citizens retain ownership and economic rights over their data.

## 💡 Why This Repository Matters

Thailand does **not** currently have a system that:

- Ensures citizens own their Real-World Data  
- Prevents unauthorized data extraction by platforms  
- Provides transparent, traceable national data infrastructure  
- Supports farmers and workers with data-based economic rights  

DGCP™ is designed to close these gaps and establish **data sovereignty**  
for every Thai citizen.

---

## 🔍 Vision

> To build Thailand’s first open, transparent, and human-first  
> Real-World Data governance framework — beginning from a small farm,  
> and expanding into a national architecture that cannot be replicated  
> backward by any institution in the world.

---

## 👥 Intended Audience

- Policymakers & government agencies  
- Data governance researchers  
- Digital economy analysts  
- Universities & institutions  
- Ethical AI and RWD ecosystem builders  
- Investors in data infrastructure  
- Civil society organizations
