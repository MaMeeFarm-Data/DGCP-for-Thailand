#  DGCP™ Data Governance Model for Thailand  
**Protecting Citizen Rights, Ensuring Transparency, and Preventing Abuse**

---

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the **Data Governance Model** for DGCP™  
as implemented in Thailand. The model is designed to ensure that:

- **citizens own their Real-World Data (RWD)**  
- **government cannot misuse or alter data**  
- **integrity and transparency are mandatory**  
- **licensing ensures legal protection**  
- **AI systems receive traceable, ethical data**  

DGCP™ is built on a human-first philosophy:  
*“Data belongs to the human who produces it.”*

## 2. Governance Principles

DGCP™ governance for Thailand is based on six core principles:

### 2.1 Human Ownership  
Every data point belongs to the person who generated the work, activity, or proof.

### 2.2 Immutability  
No entity — including the government — can delete or alter historical RWD.

### 2.3 Transparency  
All processes, timestamps, and provenance links must be auditable.

### 2.4 Licensing Protection  
MMFARM-POL-2025 governs legal rights, preventing unauthorized use.

### 2.5 Community-Centric Validation  
Validators are distributed across communities, not centralized agencies.

### 2.6 Interoperability Without Control  
Government can read standardized data but **cannot control** citizen entries.

---

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

DGCP™ defines four main stakeholder roles:

### 3.1 Citizens (Data Generators)
- Create RWD through work and daily activities  
- Own the copyright and licensing rights  
- Control access and permissions  
- Benefit economically from licensed usage  

### 3.2 Validators (Community or Local Units)
- Verify structure, metadata, and timestamp continuity  
- Ensure no fraudulent or synthetic entries  
- Maintain integrity logs  
- Cannot access private content without permission  

### 3.3 Government Entities
- Read and analyze aggregated RWD for policy-making  
- Follow licensing terms  
- Cannot override timestamps, proofs, or ownership  
- Must publish usage reports when using DGCP™ data  

### 3.4 AI / Research Institutions
- May request data access under license  
- Must cite provenance and origin  
- Must comply with ethical constraints  
- Cannot reproduce or claim ownership

## 4. Governance Mechanisms Preventing Abuse

DGCP™ includes built-in protections ensuring that no single party  
— including the government — can manipulate or exploit data.

### 4.1 Append-Only Architecture  
Once proof is created, it **cannot be erased**.

### 4.2 Cryptographic Timestamps  
Each proof has an immutable timestamp that exposes tampering.

### 4.3 Hash-Based Verification  
Content is linked to a hash/CID, proving authenticity.

### 4.4 Licensing Enforcement  
MMFARM-POL-2025 legally restricts:

- unauthorized use  
- commercial exploitation  
- government overreach  
- platform data extraction  

### 4.5 Community Validators  
Distributed validation prevents centralized control.

### 4.6 Narrative Provenance  
Every proof includes narrative/metadata context  
which cannot be fabricated retroactively.

## 5. Data Access Policy

### 5.1 Citizen Access  
Full access to their own data;  
can export, license, monetize.

### 5.2 Government Access  
Restricted to:

- aggregated data  
- anonymized insights  
- policy research  

Must comply with license and usage logs.

### 5.3 Public Access  
Depends on permission from citizens.  
DGCP™ is not an open public dataset.

### 5.4 AI / Research Access

## 6. Compliance & Ethical Requirements

Government and institutions using DGCP™ must meet:

- transparency reporting  
- bias monitoring  
- ethical AI usage  
- privacy protections  
- non-discrimination principles  
- explicit consent for sensitive RWD  

DGCP™ is not just a data model —  
it is an **ethical contract** embedded in the system.

---

## 7. Enforcement Model

DGCP™ protects citizens through:

### • Legal Enforcement  
MMFARM-POL-2025 + Copyright Law (international)

### • Technical Enforcement  
Immutability + hashes + timestamps

### • Social/Community Enforcement  
Validators and public auditability

Together, these create a **triple-layer protection**  
against misuse by government or platforms.

## 8. Why This Governance Model Matters for Thailand

Thailand needs a governance model that:

- prevents centralization abuse  
- gives power to citizens  
- ensures national transparency  
- protects farmers and workers  
- prepares for ethical AI ecosystems  

DGCP™ is currently the only model in Thailand  
that combines **human rights + technology + licensing + community validation**.

---

## 9. Conclusion

DGCP™ data governance is designed to:

- empower citizens  
- constrain government overreach  
- enable auditing  
- ensure ethical AI  
- protect rural communities  
- build national trust in digital systems  

This governance layer is the backbone of Thailand’s future  
Real-World Data civilization.
