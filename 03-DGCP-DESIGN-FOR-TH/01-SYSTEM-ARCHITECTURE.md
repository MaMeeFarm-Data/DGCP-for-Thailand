# DGCP™ System Architecture for Thailand  
**National Real-World Data Governance Blueprint**

---

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the **technical and governance architecture**  
of DGCP™ (Duck Governance & Continuous Proof) as implemented  
for Thailand at the national scale.

The architecture enables a verifiable system of:

- Real-World Data (RWD) capture  
- Proof-of-Work-Life  
- Timestamp governance  
- Licensing enforcement  
- Traceability across institutions  

DGCP™ is designed to scale from a single farm to national infrastructure  
while preserving human ownership and integrity.

---

## 2. Architectural Goals

1. **Establish a transparent, immutable RWD backbone for Thailand**  
2. **Protect citizen data rights through licensing and provenance**  
3. **Provide interoperable standards for government and private sectors**  
4. **Enable ethical AI models built on verifiable ground-truth data**  
5. **Support national digital transformation with human-first principles**

---

## 3. Core Components of DGCP™ Architecture

DGCP™ consists of four main components:

### 3.1 **RWD Capture Layer (Layer 0)**  
Captures daily work, weather, farming, and local events.  
Includes metadata such as:

- Timestamp  
- Location (if available)  
- Worker/activity type  
- Media proofs (photo, video)  
- Worker identity or anonymized entity  
- Environmental context  

This layer is append-only and human-generated.

---

### 3.2 **RWD Metadata Framework (Layer 1)**  
Defines the schema used nationwide:

- `Proof ID`  
- `Activity Type`  
- `Timestamp`  
- `Weight/Quantity`  
- `Environmental Data`  
- `Narrative Context`  
- `Hash / CID`  
- `License Ref: MMFARM-POL-2025`  

This ensures consistency for:

- agriculture  
- labor  
- logistics  
- community events  
- daily household work  

---

### 3.3 **DGCP™ Governance Layer (Layer 2)**  
Responsible for:

- data rights  
- community ownership  
- licensing enforcement  
- validator rules  
- append-only protection  
- transparency standards  

This layer defines **who can read, write, and validate RWD**  
and ensures fair value return to data contributors.

---

### 3.4 **National Integration Layer (Layer 3)**  
Coordinates cross-ministry and cross-sector usage:

- Agriculture Ministry  
- Labor Ministry  
- Digital Economy Ministry  
- Local government (TAOs)  
- Universities  
- Health and welfare programs  
- Private platforms  

Provides APIs and schema adapters where necessary.

## 4. Data Flow Overview

1. **Capture:**  
   Human performs real-world work → RWD is recorded as proof.

2. **Metadata Encoding:**  
   Structured metadata is created using national schema.

3. **Timestamping & Hashing:**  
   Proof receives an immutable timestamp and hash (CID).

4. **Storage & Licensing:**  
   Data is stored with MMFARM-POL-2025 license attached.

5. **Governance Validation:**  
   Validators confirm structure, metadata, and continuity.

6. **Publication:**  
   RWD becomes available (with permissions) for:

   - Research  
   - Policy  
   - AI models  
   - Economic programs  
   - Disaster forecasting  
   - Rural development  

---

## 5. National Interoperability Model

DGCP™ is designed to interoperate with:

- PDPA (privacy law)  
- Open Data Thailand  
- Ministry databases  
- Smart farming systems  
- Decentralized storage (CID/IPFS)  
- AI training pipelines  
- Research repositories  

DGCP™ does **not** replace existing systems —  
it **connects** them with a human-first verification layer.

---

## 6. Scalability Model

DGCP™ is designed to scale through:

### • **Horizontal expansion**  
More farms → more communities → more provinces → national coverage.

### • **Vertical expansion**  
Layer 0 → Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → Layer 4

### • **Cross-sector expansion**  
Agriculture → labor → welfare → energy → environment → logistics

---

## 7. Security & Integrity

DGCP™ ensures data integrity through:

- append-only architecture  
- timestamp governance  
- hash/CID verification  
- narrative traceability  
- continuous provenance chain  
- licensing enforcement  

Data cannot be deleted, altered, or faked retroactively.

---

## 8. Licensing Integration (MMFARM-POL-2025)

Every RWD entry includes:

- License reference  
- Ownership attribution  
- Terms of use  
- Commercial restrictions  
- Provenance link  

This creates a **legal + technical shield** around citizen data.

---

## 9. Conclusion

DGCP™ provides Thailand with the world’s first  
human-first, verifiable Real-World Data architecture.  
It is designed to:

- protect citizens  
- strengthen national competitiveness  
- enable ethical AI  
- unify government systems  
- support community-owned data economies  

This architecture is the foundation for national DGCP™ deployment.
